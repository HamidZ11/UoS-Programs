This project is a starter project 

This project is to do with a car
	There is car class and car fields that relate to the car such as make and model of the 
	car

In this project I got a zero, this is because in the constructor there were too many parameters
There were only 5 parameters in the brief and I had put a lot more 
(This has now been corrected) 

Project started and finished on Friday 11th of October
Feedback of ZERO received on Tuesday 15th October
Corrections made on Tuesday 15th October

After corrections (made based off of feedback on the early submission) I received 12/18
